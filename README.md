# Google-Books-Search

This is a self-contained app (client and server) that conducts a search on the Google Books API, displays results, saves entries to a database, and displays saved items from the database.

## Motivation and Challenges
This project was completed as part of the Michigan State University/Trilogy Web Development Bootcamp program, and represents a full MERN stack program. 

The challenges included Google Books API to function properly, using ternary operators to deal with sometimes present, sometimes absent properties on response data. Another enjoyable challenge was separating presentational and functional components and pages in client/src/.
